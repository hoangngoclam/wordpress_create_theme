# WordPress Docker Compose

Easy WordPress development with Docker and Docker Compose.

With this project you can quickly run the following:

- [WordPress](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/)
- [phpMyAdmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/)
- [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/)

## Requirements

Make sure you have the latest versions of **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.

## Configuration

Run the file setup before run docker-compose

```
sh setup.sh
```

Edit the file `.env` just creatd to change the MySQL root password and WordPress database name.

## RUN

* `wp-app` â€“ the location of your WordPress application

The containers are now built and running. You should be able to access the WordPress installation with url `http://localhost`.

For convenience you may add a new entry into your hosts file.

Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

### phpMyAdmin

You can also visit `http://localhost:8080` to access phpMyAdmin after starting the containers.

The default username is `root`, and the password is the same as supplied in the `.env` file.

You can accept the website with URL: `http://localhost`
